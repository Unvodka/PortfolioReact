                <p className="description" style={{backgroundColor: darkMode ? '#222' : 'wheat'}}>Hi, 
        My name is Arnaud and i'm a junior Web Developer.
        I did a full-stack Javascript course on <a href='https://www.codecademy.com.' rel="noreferrer" target='_blank'>https://www.codecademy.com</a> wich thaught me fondamentals of javascript and the web, then i started to learn how to use MongoDb, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to follow the MERN stack.
        I kept studying around Javascript, Redux and i'm now building small web applications and open to any additional training or job.
        <br></br>
        I'm still watching tons of tutorials, and take a special look at the documentation available for each technology that i'm using. Wich is good for fast and better understanding of technologies specifications and schemas.<br />

        Now i want to put my recent acquired skills to your service while observing your experience to take the best of it and make our collaboration a real synergy in term of work, results and conditions.
<br></br><br></br>
        So, i'm seeking for a company who need a brand new web developer to find quickly my place in the coding ship. <br></br>

        Here is my Github : <a href='https://github.com/Unvodka' rel="noreferrer" target='_blank'>https://github.com/Unvodka</a> <br></br>

        Im a happy person, not shy, enthousiast and good learner. <br></br>
        Please let me know if we could help each other and find something.

        Best regards
